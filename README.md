# 🏠 Predicting Housing Prices with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict house sale prices based on various property features such as size, condition, and amenities. The goal is to identify the most significant factors influencing property value and build a reliable predictive model.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a model that accurately estimates housing prices using features such as:

- Number of Bedrooms  
- Living Area (square meters)  
- Property Condition  
- Presence of a Basement  
- Scenic Views  
- Renovation History  

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains property listings with detailed information about physical characteristics, conditions, and sale prices. It has been preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `ProjectDS_ParteI_+D'ercole.ipynb`: Main notebook with full analysis and model development  
- `df_test.csv`: Test dataset used during evaluation  

---

## 📈 Model(s) Used

- Linear Regression  
- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Evaluation using regression metrics:  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - R-squared (R²)  

---

## 📌 Conclusions

The model confirms that features like living area, property condition, and the number of bedrooms are strong predictors of sale price. The project demonstrates how interpretable regression models can support real estate decision-making by identifying the most impactful property attributes.
